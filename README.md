To run:

* `python download_images.py <dir>`

This script reads through markdown files in the `dir` folder and downloads the images contained in each file. The images are saved into a folder with the same name as the corresponding markdown file (excluding the file extension). The images are saved with filenames that match the filename for the url referenced in the markdown file.
